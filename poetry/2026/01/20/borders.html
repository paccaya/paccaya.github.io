Dedicated to you,<br>
I trace the edges of my skin.<br>
Caressing the bounds,<br>
tearing me whole,<br>
finding only myself in the middle of forever.
</p>

<p>
To the boxes I seek to touch,<br>
there is no outside.<br>
I find that I am not confined.<br>
Fluid as we are, as I border all.<br>
In this solitude, I am watered by the unknown.
</p>

<p>
Oh blessed unknown-<br>
In the beginning,<br>
I pretended to not know you.<br>
But now I know you to be<br>
the eternal, timeless mother of creation.
</p>

<p>
These threadbare openings may seem a bit shabby,<br>
but that is no issue for a community strengthened by tragedy.<br>
For our umbilical cord has never been cut,<br>
reaching out I only find myself.
