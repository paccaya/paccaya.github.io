    <main><p>I am the tilt of Earth,<br>
as we are the winters that are cradled.</p>

<p>I am the freezing winds,<br>
as we are the muscles that shiver us into a harminous warmth.</p>

<p>I am the geese migrating,<br>
as we are those moved by their yoked formations.</p>

<p>I am the witch hazel,<br>
as we are those cold pollinating wanderers seeking refuge.</p>

<p>I am the blanketing snow,<br>
as we are the terrain of earth graciously being put to rest.</p>

<p>I am the gushing snowmelt,<br>
as we are pampered in extra hydration.</p>

<p>I am the disturbing avalanche,<br>
as we are the land mosaicked in restoration.</p>

<p>I am the tenacious overwintering insects,<br>
as we are plants greeted in generous pollination.</p>

<p>I am the hibernating creatures,<br>
as we are those cells unwinding into deep rest.</p>

<p>I am those seasonal times,<br>
as we emboson circlar life.</p>

<p>Unknowingly to the promise of Spring,<br>
in that primaveral corridor,<br>
Winter silently sings our lives back into renewal.</p>

<p>I lament leaving the arms of this winter,<br>
as we are embraced in soft, luminous water,<br>
so brightened by that golden, milky honeydew.<br>
Our sun so mooning in those reflective faces.<br>
This snow a gift of care<br>
whisking us to parity.</p>

<p>There is an ice to my pain<br>
with such chilling ardor,<br>
though balanced with this pain,<br>
laying dormant,<br>
is my love for a true, pulsing reunion<br>
as I await a winter apricity.<br>
