    <main><p>What if going nowhere was the requirement of transformation?<br>
This act of going nowhere<br>
This challenging act<br>
to not want to run,<br>
escape<br>
or flee from our darkest moments<br>
and instead, shrouded in thse shadows,<br>
to measure ourselves<br>
but to simply meet ourselves in that deep bay of solitude we often avoid.<br>
To be both the dark, boat, and lighthouse on our return back to home?<br>
To bask in the dark tar that sticks ourselves in our most hardened, discarded, and forsaken parts of ourselves<br>
only to realize that black tar<br>
to be that cradling net of the living dark,<br>
holding the stars in their separate togetherness.</p>

<p>What if remaining in all that confuses, betrays, annoys us<br>
—this intense discomfort, pain, and, sorrow,<br>
and to lie resting<br>
right within in the wound<br>
lie our antidote?</p>

<p>For is it not in full contact with a wound,<br>
it's torn edges and all<br>
where our wholeness begins to extend<br>
where healing takes place?</p>

<p>Is it not through<br>
holding,<br>
touching,<br>
bearing witness,<br>
and extending ourselves<br>
into that streaming, blood-stricken, beaten body impassioned with rage,<br>
a rage<br>
of our impassioned love for justice<br>
and feeling our feelings in full witness<br>
to this hurt<br>
that allows us to sink deeper into others?<br>
To then float into that deep, primordial force<br>
and to tap us all into renewal<br>
into that stream of steady, pulsing vitality<br>
that is found enmeshed and mothering<br>
all of life?</p>

<p>To skip these hardened stones,<br>
rough and jaded and exhausted<br>
into the depths of water<br>
to soften their shapes.<br>
To create circles in edges<br>
and act as the foundation of streams.</p>

<p>Our stony pain always has a story to tell, as water falls and rivers through.</p>

<p>What if remaining in these burning places,<br>
allows us to kindle our own flame<br>
of love<br>
of rebirth<br>
and regneration and veneration?</p>

<p>That only in between the thorns,<br>
we find roses?</p>

<p>Is it not through meeting numbness, despair, and suffering<br>
to toil within its waves<br>
until its rocking extinguishes<br>
that we find our reunion with life<br>
most awakening?<br>
Most enlivening, reviving, resurrecting?</p>

<p>For to lie in the deepest of darkenings,<br>
renews an ardent, intense illumination of fiery cosmic light.</p>

<p>What if resting in this dark<br>
we lie in the ancient nest of creation?<br>
Lying in tandem<br>
with the stars that enwomb the direction of life.</p>

<p>What if residing in where we find the most pain<br>
could bring us songs of joy extending<br>
from seed<br>
to a lush thicket<br>
of a generational wealth?</p>

<p>What if sanctuary was not a place,<br>
but a practice?<br>
This everlasting practice to nurture<br>
a palace<br>
out of any place.</p>

<p>What if we saw this jungled pain<br>
as a canopied, loving reminder<br>
to how entangled we are?</p>

<p>What if experiencing exactly who you are now,<br>
resting in this nowhere,<br>
releases us everywhere?</p>

<p>To fully face our pain and become star-strewn?</p>
