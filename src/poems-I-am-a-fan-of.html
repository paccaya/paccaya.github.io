<h3>Alexandria</h3>
<p>A woman lived in ancient times;<br>
she could not read or write.<br>
But oh, the stories she could tell<br>
were each a soul's delight.</p>

<p>The introvert has many thoughts,<br>
but most will stay within.<br>
And when he dies, those thoughts<br>
will fade,<br>
as if they'd never been.</p>

<p>The elderly have lived their days,<br>
and time has left its mark.<br>
There's history within their minds,<br>
of love and loss and lark.</p>

<p>Who knows what knowledge becomes lost<br>
Each time life's hourglass turns.<br>
For people live, then people go;<br>
with each, a library burns.</p>
</p>

<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p><i>Author unknown</i></p>
<p>
Always a mask<br>
Held in the slim hand whitely<br>
Always she had a mask before her<br>
face-<br>
Truly the wrist<br>
Holding it lightly<br>
Fitted the task:<br>
Sometimes however<br>
Was there a shiver,<br>
Fingertip quiver,<br>
Ever so slightly-<br>
Holding the mask ?</p>

<p>
For years and years and years I<br>
wondered<br>
But dared not ask<br>
And then-<br>
I blundered,<br>
Looked behind the mask,<br>
To find<br>
Nothing-<br>
She had no face.
</p>

<p>
She had become<br>
Merely a hand<br>
Holding a mask<br>
With grace.
</p>
