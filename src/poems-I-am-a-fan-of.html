<h3>Alexandria</h3>
<p>A woman lived in ancient times;<br>
she could not read or write.<br>
But oh, the stories she could tell<br>
were each a soul's delight.</p>

<p>The introvert has many thoughts,<br>
but most will stay within.<br>
And when he dies, those thoughts<br>
will fade,<br>
as if they'd never been.</p>

<p>The elderly have lived their days,<br>
and time has left its mark.<br>
There's history within their minds,<br>
of love and loss and lark.</p>

<p>Who knows what knowledge becomes lost<br>
Each time life's hourglass turns.<br>
For people live, then people go;<br>
with each, a library burns.</p>
