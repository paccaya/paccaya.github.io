<p>When I hold this stream,<br>
this stream of life waving,<br>
I am answered by the many drowning.</p>

<p>Those who are crying out. Those<br>
who are screaming. Those<br>
who are so desolate that they allow the water to burn them out.<br>
But also, those whose cries are answered by the caring.</p>

<p>In these times, we have become better in<br>
turning the tides,<br>
rescuing the many,<br>
tending to our flowing wounds.</p>

<p>However, I see the people overburdened—<br>
the wound's horizon, ever expansive,<br>
unsure if we can even measure its atmosphere;<br>
the riverbed hemming and hawing,<br>
unsure if we can even see its gift of life.</p>

<p>I see these people mangled, disfigured, and hurt.<br>
For what anguish have we given to our gifts of water.<br>
What toil need we endure through<br>
to only be left hardened by water.</p>

<p>The life we water,<br>
we can only bear.</p>

<p>This water bearing our life unwavering.</p>

<p>That is why I ask that riverbend,<br>
what comes before you?</p>

<p>I am answered by the many drowning.</p>
