<p>
When I inquire to the way you feel,<br>
your words eclipse your speech.
</p>

<p>
The sun of your pain is so evident<br>
yet it is the moon you speak as,<br>
pushing and pulling waves of chilling bitterness.<br>
The water that we are calls me to swim.
</p>

<p>I ride the penumbra of discovery,<br>
a seething celestial flare.<br>
I catch that burning passion<br>
that you, oh so pained,<br>
are so reluctant to confront
</p>

<p>These are the pillars of creation of a stellar nursery.</p>
