<p>
  On the steeped edges of an abyss,<br>
  birthed a gaping crevice
</p>

<p>
  Cavernous sides bespoke a tale of rifting connection.<br>
  A divide so vast that the binding crust<br>
  was forgotten,<br>
  yet a river valley began anew.
</p>

<p>
  It is where we seem most divided<br>
  that a deep connection can be unleashed.
