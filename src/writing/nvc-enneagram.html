<p>Nonviolent communication could be described as a language of life. It was founded by Marshall B. Rosenburg, Ph.D. (1934-2015) during the 1960s, living into our time today, and is a way of spiritualized speech. The embodiment of this speech relinks ourselves back to our deep needs and longings, without getting there through criticism, guilt, blame, name-calling, and coercion.</p>

<p>Enneagram derives from the Greek root <i>ennéa</i>, meaning "nine", and <i>gramma</i> which means "written" or "drawn". It denotes nine overarching strategies with corresponding characteristics that describe people through a collection of their traits.</p>

<p>I happened to stumble upon Julie Lawrence's wonderful <a  class="text-gray-500 underline" href="https://makinglifemorewonderful.com.au/">website</a> that housed a <a class="text-gray-500 underline" href="https://makinglifemorewonderful.com.au/false-needs/">blog post</a> named: <i>"false" needs? enneagram and nvc</i>. In this report was a connection of nonviolent communication to an enneagram—a personality typing construction that connects basic fears, desires, weaknesses, and longings to a typification.</p>

<p>What makes an enneagram so telling is that it reveals beliefs or values that may conflict with what we may need on a deeper level.</p>

<p>Julie Lawrence then goes on to write about a strategy to identify 'false needs':</p>

<div class="indent">
  <blockquote>
    <i>So how do we know when what seems to be “meeting a need” is actually a faulty strategy? One hint might be, <b>when it creates more pain than happiness.</b></i>
  </blockquote>
</div>

<p>False needs are like staccato, which is Italian for detached, meaning that they are needs that are divorced from what we are truly seeking out. Not only are they temporary and give you short pulses of release, but they also increase an underlying air of tension in a relationship.</p>

<p>So now, going forth, how exactly could one use this understanding to serve life-sustaining purposes? Well... that is quite a difficult question to ask, as courage and conflict are inextricably linked and integral to shifting from neglecting our needs to meeting them.</p>

<p>Conflict is sacred inasmuch as it allows for us to become in touch with our shared needs. Often times, we have a deep sense of anger or fear within our hearts when our needs are being met: whether that the fear of not being worthy enough or resentment and mistrust because of another's actions. Joanna Macy once said,</p>

<blockquote><i>Crisis is one of the factors that can cause people to pull together.</i></blockquote>

<p>A lot of people nowadays are fearful of their own anger, taking it to be an emotion that separates and distances rather than one that connects. So we repress it, only to face the dire consequence of neglecting both ourselves and the other we are attempting to connect with.</p>

<p>There is an interesting quip that I heard from a talk by David R. Loy:</p>

<blockquote><i>Anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.<br>...<br>Just make sure to give the poison to the other guy.</i></blockquote>

<p>He then challenges: <i>Maybe we do shouldn't give it to either one, right?</i></p>

<p>This is quite profound because it takes our commonplace understanding of anger entirely. It flips the script, so to speak, paralleling that of Joanna Macy: our anger is our passion for justice, our fear makes way for us to act courageously.</p>

<p>Now how exactly do we cultivate the courage in order to face our fear and go in and through the conflict that we face? We think of courage not as something that you <i>have</i> but as a verb: something that you <i>do</i> or even more piercing: something that you <i>are</i>. Macy goes through this in <i>Active Hope: How to Face the Mess We're in with Unexpected Resilience and Creative Power</i>.</p>

<p>I highly suggest checking it out because of how immensely helpful it has been in both understanding where we are now and how we can go forth with a sense of belonging and gratitude; both of which seem to be lacking in the values many hold today.</p>
